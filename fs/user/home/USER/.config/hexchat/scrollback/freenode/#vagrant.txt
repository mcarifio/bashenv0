T 1586951747 18<StyXman18>	how can I find the ports that vagrant is supposed to be forwarding from my host machine (my NB) to the virtualbox machine I just (indirectly) told it to build?
T 1587001012 18<supremekai18>	Hey guys, I'm trying to install vagrant but I'm getting a windows defender alert.. is this normal?
T 1587049541 18<Jackneill18>	hey
T 1587049547 18<Jackneill18>	im getting started
T 1587049559 18<Jackneill18>	for a lightweight provider i am looking at lxc
T 1587049570 18<Jackneill18>	but the top box is 205th times downloaded
T 1587049590 18<Jackneill18>	do people generally prefer libvirt over virtualbox?
T 1587049634 18<Jackneill18>	vbox provider reqquires vagrant up to run as root, but later checks for UID, so its annoying that i have to run vagrant as sudo from then on
T 1587050665 18<rapidwave18>	Is afterScriptPath not a real variable?
T 1587050766 18<rapidwave18>	Is has been working until now https://gist.github.com/ojabi/953bd7add202d9f4dcb98e739d783e5d
T 1587052273 18<`brian18>	Jackneill: virtualbox is for sure the most popular provide, you shouldn't need root access to run vagrant
T 1587052307 18<Jackneill18>	right
T 1587052311 18<`brian18>	it's possible you ran `sudo vagrant status` or any vagrant command with sudo. what happens is vagrant makes a small `.vagrant` folder that stores some metadata as the user that ran the command, so that is possible why it seems that you need sudo
T 1587052324 18<`brian18>	because it can't read the initial metadata folder due to it being created by the root user
T 1587052354 18<`brian18>	if all your machines are destroyed it should be safe to remove that .vagrant folder and run vagrant as your local user
T 1587055005 18<rapidwave18>	Will somoene please take a look at my config, the error is on hte paste https://gist.github.com/ojabi/953bd7add202d9f4dcb98e739d783e5d
T 1587055654 18<`brian18>	rapidwave: a variable is missing, you need to define that variable
T 1587055737 18<`brian18>	rapidwave: https://github.com/laravel/homestead/blob/master/Vagrantfile
T 1587055753 18<`brian18>	afterScriptPath = confDir + "/after.sh"
T 1587055860 18<rapidwave18>	That should be the definition?
T 1587055875 18<`brian18>	according to homestead
T 1587055887 18<`brian18>	this is a vagrant channel though, not homestead
T 1587055896 18<`brian18>	homestead is its own project
T 1587055899 18<`brian18>	that uses vagrant
T 1587056642 18<rapidwave18>	It is Vagrant script for controlling Vagrant, therefore it actually is Vagrant related
T 1587056673 18<rapidwave18>	Homestead configuration has it's own file
T 1587057079 18<`brian18>	it's not vagrant related :/

T 1587127410 18<jomitsch18>	my hunch is the large box size

T 1587130220 18<roadster196618>	ssh is definitely running on the VM, I can connect using a private network IP address, so it seems there is wrong with Vagrant, not my local OS or the VM. HALP PLEASE ! Anyone ..?

T 1587140112 18<roadster196618>	i cannot fully run up any VMs, vagrant cannot provision anything because it cannot connect, but I can ssh into the VMs using a private network address
T 1587140185 18<`brian18>	is this true for different vagrant boxes or just the one you're using
T 1587140731 18<roadster196618>	true for both of the two i have setup
T 1587140788 18<`brian18>	how about the box `hashicorp/bionic64`?
T 1587140896 18<roadster196618>	i can try it, but my boxes were working fine and have been for 8 months
T 1587140942 18<`brian18>	sure.... virtual machines are not immutable though
T 1587140947 18<`brian18>	they change
T 1587140996 18<`brian18>	it sounds like though it might be an issue with your systems SSH based on the error you shared, so that's why I'm asking you to try different boxes, if they all have the same error then that confirms it
T 1587141025 18<`brian18>	if different boxes don't have the same issue, then it's probably just an issue with the box you are using
T 1587141049 18<roadster196618>	ok i will try tomorrow, very late here now. thanks
T 1587141062 18<`brian18>	alright, no worries
T 1587141079 18<`brian18>	I think I saw you opened a GH issue, maybe update us on there once you try out the different box
T 1587141094 18<roadster196618>	will do
T 1587141123 18<roadster196618>	odd that i can ssh into these boxes tho, but vagrant can't...
T 1587141196 18<`brian18>	you said it doesn't work on the provision step? vagrant uses net-ssh to do that
T 1587141206 18<`brian18>	not your system ssh binary directly, like the `vagrant ssh` command does
T 1587141256 18<roadster196618>	yes the error mentions net-ssh. but seems to prove that the box is fine, because i can ssh into it
T 1587141276 18<`brian18>	can you ssh into it using vagrant ssh?
T 1587141297 18<roadster196618>	no, using ssh from command line
T 1587141324 18<`brian18>	what is the error you get if you use `vagrant ssh`?
T 1587141325 18<roadster196618>	i setup a private network address for each vm, i can connect to those
T 1587141492 18<roadster196618>	nothing, vagrant ssh does not connect or give any error

T 1587141578 18<roadster196618>	just quits

T 1587685169 18<`brian18>	TomyWork: basically running `vagrant up --debug` and seeing what it's doing during the networking step

T 1587685973 18<TomyWork18>	well i got the network interface working with "dhclient ens5"
T 1587685985 18<TomyWork18>	which is fine for now, i guess
T 1587686001 18<`brian18>	often times packer templates have specific scripts that setup boxes for networking and other features based on the specific provider...so converting it could possibly leave out that configuration
T 1587686020 18<TomyWork18>	yeah i'll figure that out in time :)
T 1587686024 18<`brian18>	yep!
T 1587686040 18<`brian18>	well, one thing that might make things go faster for you is finding packer templates for libvirt and seeing what the networking scripts do
T 1587686046 18<TomyWork18>	a more pressing problem is that vagrant can't reach ssh while i'm in my vpn
T 1587686076 18<TomyWork18>	and i cant provision the VM without the vpn :)
T 1587686086 18<`brian18>	vagrant usually uses your system ssh to go into the guest, with the ip 127.0.0.1, so it's possible that's why it's messing up
T 1587686101 18<`brian18>	not sure tho
T 1587686109 18<TomyWork18>	yeah with virtualbox, it makes a port forward

T 1587686139 18<`brian18>	I think

T 1588556402 18<jmcgnh18>	the issue response says, this could just be a matter of calling for sshfs without having the corresponding plugin installed. But if you've already tried that, then it may be faster to try some alternatives.

T 1600562850 18<Seven_Six_Two18>	are there known issues with composer and vagrant? I'm trying to install drupal commerce from within a vagrant box, in a folder mounted to have www-data user and group for apache
T 1600562885 18<Seven_Six_Two18>	but it fails every time on including cweagans/composer-patches
T 1600563090 18<Seven_Six_Two18>	I've tried user www-data group vagrant as well, but same issue
T 1600563706 18<jmcgnh18>	Seven_Six_Two:-->  This doesn't sound very much like a vagrant problem. All vagrant does is create the VM and leave some metadata available allowing you to talk to it. Once the VM is up, you can mount additional filesystems and install additional software, but problems you experience at that point have to be tracked down to how you've set up the VM
T 1600563706 18<jmcgnh18>	and perhaps expectations of the software you are installing. It's certainly possible that something you're wanting to do is finicky about permissions. For some pieces of software, it is faster to locate a box with that software is already installed and configured.
T 1600564066 18<Seven_Six_Two18>	jmcgnh, oh that's a very nice suggestion...I'll bet there's a box with it already. thanks
T 1600564139 18<Seven_Six_Two18>	I didn't expect it to be a vagrant problem, perse, only that someone here may have come across it before.
