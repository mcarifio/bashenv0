T 1510337531 18<genec18>	maxzor: IRC is IRC.  HexChat is merely one popular client.
T 1510337555 18<hog18>	I thought you were going to say HexChat is HexChat

T 1510337592 18<maxzor18>	jk,genec, i messed with my proxy trying to port forward ssh. I have not irc in my protocol list, and this stuff does not let me configure tcp port 6667
T 1510337686 18<genec18>	maxzor: I've reconfigured different server connections to 6697, 7000, 7070 and a few others as necessary
T 1510337712 18<jk18>	I‚Äôm not understanding
T 1510337758 18<genec18>	maxzor: some proxies allow arbitrary destination ports.
T 1510337849 18<genec18>	maxzor: are you trying to use a hide-my-self proxy or are you in an environment where you don't have Internet access except through the proxy?  I'm confused by why the proxy matters or is there
T 1510337979 18<maxzor18>	genec : yes my house local internet is behind a nat (in my mind nats and proxies are interchangeable), I need it to access wan. Im writing atm on irc web client, pure irc clients cannot reach any irc server. And the only thing my nat configuration lets me do is to choose between the above long list.
T 1510338009 18<genec18>	maxzor: NATs and proxies are NOT the same
T 1510338126 18<genec18>	maxzor: did you try any of the other ports that freenode uses as listed on https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat ?
T 1510338135 18<maxzor18>	well, I believe my issue can be summed as "I need to port forward tcp 6667 on an unfriendly nat configurator"
T 1510338301 18<genec18>	maxzor: IME, you don't need to port-forward UNLESS outside people are connecting in.  otoh, your ISP might have an outbound firewall in place
T 1510338415 18<Sagan18>	if you are not authed, and you are here, will you get then something like this?

T 1510338478 18<genec18>	Sagan: for the moment, yes.
T 1510338506 18<Sagan18>	a bit annoying: your client reconnected, joined this chan, and you want to identify before the 30 secs, and are on a nick which does not belong to you, but you can't change it
T 1510338520 18<genec18>	Sagan: look at the quiet list.  "$~a" is the entry that bans unidentified users from changing since they are not allowed to speak
T 1510338524 18<MetaNova18>	Sagan: /msg nickserv identify account password
T 1510338526 18<genec18>	Sagan: SASL
T 1510338540 18<MetaNova18>	you don't need to be using the nick of your account to identify to it
T 1510338541 18<genec18>	MetaNova: less reliable than SASL
T 1510338545 18<MetaNova18>	also, configure SASL
T 1510338552 18<MetaNova18>	as genec suggested
T 1510338555 18<Sagan18>	yeah, I know. anyway, for a client I started to setup a bit... meh
T 1510338598 18<genec18>	Sagan: the $~a entry isn't always on this channel but it is present when the climate becomes a little harsh
T 1510338640 18<Sagan18>	genec: heh, I'm not that new here ;). just wasn't sure, if this was the reason, since I never got banned here (and don't want to)
T 1510338686 18<genec18>	Sagan: yes, a +q that matches will prevent a user from changing nicks
T 1510338801 18<genec18>	Sagan: but using SASL will prevent you from joining channels before being identified
T 1510338894 18<Sagan18>	genec: hm, yeah. (normally the client should not join the chans automatically anyway). thx for checking anway :)
T 1510338903 18<maxzor18>	ty for inputs genec
T 1510338907 18<Sagan18>	going to configure it anyway
T 1510339255 18<genec18>	maxzor: so your web app must be capable of reaching out to say chat.freenode.net/6697 but for your web app to be reachable from another connection, 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) will need a port forward.
T 1510339547 18<eht_18>	I keep getting the error 'Nick eht is temporarily unavailable'.  What can I do to fix that?
T 1510339578 18<eht_18>	Notably I was able to authenticate, just unable to /nick eht
T 1510339599 18<SonicTheHedgehog18>	eht_: It is because you have enabled nick protection, someone tried to use the nickname and it got squatted by a services enforcer. See /msg nickserv help release
