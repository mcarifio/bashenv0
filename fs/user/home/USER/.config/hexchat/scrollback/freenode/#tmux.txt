T 1589715020 18<avih18>	your main problem is that you did too many changes together, and almost all of them are incorrect, so it's hard to pinpoint. you can put the assignments normally without if to see if that works.

T 1589715628 18<avih18>	also, i don't think you need -b at the if command. why do you want to run it in the background?
T 1589715782 18<eggbean18>	I think just copied that from the earlier conditional arguments.  It makes sense them to run in the backgorund?

T 1589716051 18<avih18>	i'm not sure how it should behave with the command in the background, but it could mean that it becomes a-synchronous, which means that the variables will be set even later
T 1589716069 18<avih18>	IMO remove the -b as well
T 1589716271 18<avih18>	and also, this might (not sure) be running inside the tmux env, which means that $TERM is no longer xterm-whatever but rather e.g. tmux or screen or tmux-256color etc
T 1589716304 18<avih18>	so you might want to test it with a format rather than a shell command
T 1589716332 18<avih18>	(also not sure if this would work, haven't tried)
T 1589716404 18<eggbean18>	avih: I just need to put 'quotes' around the variables

It seems like the appropriate place for this kind of functionality would be in the shell itself, perhaps on the basis of a unique per-shell identifier.  That
T 1600362260 18<natechan18>	way, when tmux-resurrect restores the various shells, they would each be launched with the relevant identifier from tmux (at which point tmux's role here ends) and the shell would be responsible for loading and displaying the old stdout/stderr and so on.

T 1600435338 18<oxek18>	$TERM should be set by the terminal emulator, yes, but you have to set it manually in tmux.conf to get proper color
T 1600435347 18<Khaytsus18>	I was thinking the general notion is if you're setting TERM manually something is wrong somewhere?
T 1600435450 18<oxek18>	there's a lot of bad info about this. It is *always* wrong to set TERM in your .bashrc (or equivalent), your terminal emulator should set TERM properly. That is true. However, if you then run screen/tmux or other things, those tools should set the TERM value themselves, and a lot of the time you have to fix this value in those tool's config files.
T 1600435572 18<oxek18>	forunately, there's not much difference between tmux & tmux-256color in terms of behavior, just color. Run 'infocmp -L tmux tmux-256color' to see the differences.
