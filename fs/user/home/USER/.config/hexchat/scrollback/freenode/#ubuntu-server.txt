T 1600269777 18<bnason18>	Is there any way to get the ubuntu server installer to use the cloud config file automatically from a floppy/cd? I'm trying to use Packer to automate creating my vm templates in vsphere and the only way I've gotten it to work (and every example online shows) it using boot_commands and hosting a http server for the cloud-init. The http server is problematic since my vcenter server isn't able to communicate with my local machine.
T 1600269786 18<bnason18>	So I've had to create a script to automate creating a ssh reverse proxy to a server it can communicate with.

T 1600273114 18<smoser18>	bnason: im' not sure why it would be finick. cloud-init is probably running your boot command.
