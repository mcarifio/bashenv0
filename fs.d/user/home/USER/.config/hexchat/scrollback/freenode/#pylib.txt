T 1586589244 18<famubu18>	Hi. I was trying to create two tests grouped under a test class to be used with pytest. These two test functions use the same data for conducting their tests. Is there some way I can declare it as part of the test class and use it in the test functions? I tried just declaring outside the functions but inside the class but that didn't work. Any ideas?
T 1586600194 18<linovia18>	That's strange. py.test would not override asserts when the function is written along with source code but is imported and executed with the tests

T 1588868692 18<dude-x18>	a subclass that has a matching name for a class attribute will override the base class

T 1588872301 18<omry18>	but I will try it.
T 1588872626 18<dude-x18>	you can define stuff in Base class where the variable doesn't exist

T 1588872719 18<dude-x18>	you can also alias stuff: def calculate_foo(self);...    y = calculate_foo (just the function object)
T 1588873399 18<omry18>	dude-x, seems to work. (and of course now I got some real issues  to fix :) , thanks a lot.

T 1588873873 18<dude-x18>	i'll try the module function inside the class
T 1588873875 18<dude-x18>	see how that works
T 1588873907 18<omry18>	dude-x, we have established that a proper method in the class works.
T 1588873918 18<omry18>	I am just curious as to what the cause of the problem with this example is.
T 1588873941 18<omry18>	this should be similar to a @staticmethod,  I think
T 1588873964 18<dude-x18>	y = global_foo is kind of like a function defined without self
T 1588874155 18<dude-x18>	without staticmethod, you will have to do something like Class.y 
T 1588874432 18<omry18>	ohh, gotcha. so Python does not know how to call this weird method like that.
T 1588874479 18<dude-x18>	well typically with classes you work with instances
T 1588874500 18<dude-x18>	so if you have an instance, it will do a thing where it passes itself into a function
T 1588874524 18<omry18>	yeah, the reason I went that way is that the function I am normally dealing with is a global one and not a member.
T 1588874539 18<omry18>	https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorial/simple_cli
T 1588874561 18<dude-x18>	you can probably do y = staticmethod(global_foo)
T 1588874568 18<dude-x18>	then self.y will work
T 1588874571 18<omry18>	cool.
T 1588874629 18<dude-x18>	yeah that works
T 1588874664 18<dude-x18>	then self.y will work in regular methods
T 1588874857 18<omry18>	still getting used to decorators being used as regular methods :)
T 1588874875 18<dude-x18>	a decorator is synatic sugar for x = wrapper(x)
T 1588874888 18<dude-x18>	x = func(x)
T 1588874893 18<omry18>	yup, I know. it just throws me off every time.
T 1588874901 18<dude-x18>	i know the feeling
T 1588874912 18<omry18>	if you look at the hydra link above you will see that I use a decorator there.
T 1588874914 18<dude-x18>	"ooh, yeah i didn't think of doing that but that makes sense"

T 1589566635 18<dude-x18>	problem with runtime error is that it's not an error based off Exception
T 1589566648 18<acetakwas18>	But I expected it not to fail my test since I wrote it within a `with pytest.raises`

T 1589569176 18<The-Compiler18>	ah, looks like their testclient is based on requests, so the requests.sessions.get on top of the stacktrace probably is the "client.get"
T 1589569228 18<The-Compiler18>	acetakwas: does it work if you move the "continue" outside of the with-block?
T 1589569320 18<The-Compiler18>	*ah*, I see it now!
T 1589569325 18<acetakwas18>	The-Compiler: Wow!
T 1589569328 18<acetakwas18>	That worked!
T 1589569332 18<The-Compiler18>	acetakwas: if you have the try/except with the continue inside it (like now), you'd see the same
T 1589569356 18<acetakwas18>	Why is that?
T 1589569377 18<The-Compiler18>	acetakwas: because there's a (suppressed) exception, so the "continue" never gets called, so your second client.get(endpoint).json() gets called *too*, and *that* fails (also see the > on line 83)
T 1589569405 18<acetakwas18>	Ah!
T 1589569407 18<acetakwas18>	Right!

T 1589569552 18<acetakwas18>	Thanks.
T 1589569561 18<The-Compiler18>	acetakwas: also FWIW I'd probably make _add_transient_routes a fixture, use @pytest.mark.parametrize instead of a for loop, and maybe even split the good/bad ones into two separate tests
T 1589569598 18<acetakwas18>	Right. But there's a reason I'm doing things this way.

T 1600264592 18<The-Compiler18>	I'm not really familiar with Flask/SQLAlchemy/pytest_pgsql, so not sure I can be of much help :)
T 1600264617 18<Please_help_me18>	that's a how I'm creating a table and my controller, I want to use pytest-pgsql or any library that can spin up an in memory instance of postgres
T 1600264641 18<Please_help_me18>	thats alright, thank you The-Compiler 
T 1600264725 18<The-Compiler18>	I suppose you can't easily run your tests against sqlite instead? AFAIK that's the standard choice for in-memory databases
T 1600265150 18<Please_help_me18>	hmm I will try that, there is something called tempfile that will probably help
T 1600287412 18<jim4718>	Hi folks. how to check from the plugin view, if a custom_hook has been put in the users's conftest file ?
T 1600341893 18<AutomatedTester18>	Hi All, I am trying to do custom xfails in a fixture based on options passed in when running the tests
T 1600341933 18<AutomatedTester18>	we used to have it but now I am trying to update pytest since we're on an older version
T 1600341966 18<AutomatedTester18>	I have https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/py/conftest.py#L85-L94
T 1600342009 18<AutomatedTester18>	I have tried `get_closest_marker` which gives me a bit of what I need
T 1600349879 18<dude-x18>	AutomatedTester what do you mean by custom xfails
T 1600349922 18<dude-x18>	okay i understand now after looking at the code
T 1600349923 18<AutomatedTester18>	well... it's a custom marker that we then tell our conftest that it's a xfail
T 1600350075 18<dude-x18>	this code is using a lot of internals.... also i think this particular bit of code belongs in a pytest hook during the collection phase, but it seems that the test defines the driver used...
T 1600350149 18<dude-x18>	yes i would use request.iter_mark i think
T 1600350159 18<dude-x18>	to look for the xfail_browser mark
T 1600350508 18<AutomatedTester18>	I tried that but it's not always working
T 1600350714 18<dude-x18>	AutomatedTester so for mark in request.iter_markers() is not working?
T 1600350734 18<dude-x18>	well i mean it works but is it xfailing the wrong node
T 1600350819 18<AutomatedTester18>	that's a good question
T 1600350829 18<AutomatedTester18>	I didn't look too deeply and I should have
T 1600350849 18<AutomatedTester18>	I am getting cases where it's not entering `fin` for the cases where it has the marker
T 1600350853 18<AutomatedTester18>	I should look deeper
T 1600350975 18<dude-x18>	in theory, a function with xfail_firefox should be among the first set of markers found, but if a class or higher scope is marked for failure then it may do the wrong thing.
T 1600351005 18<dude-x18>	well it's function scoped so that should limit the "damage"
T 1600351024 18<AutomatedTester18>	yea
T 1600351043 18<AutomatedTester18>	I am going through multiple rabbit holes at the same time here... which is "fun"
