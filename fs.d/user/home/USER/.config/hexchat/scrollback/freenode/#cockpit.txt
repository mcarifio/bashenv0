T 1600258897 18<garrett18>	it's the terminal not sizing properly

T 1600258924 18<kkoukiou18>	garrett: right - I see it - only the serial console

T 1600259384 18<pitti18>	garrett: oh, so this was real after all? (not sure if I'm happy or not now)
T 1600259399 18<garrett18>	pitti: I'm not sure, I was playing about in Safari and somehow triggered it
T 1600259408 18<garrett18>	pitti: by messing with the CSS in the DOM live

T 1600259480 18<garrett18>	kkoukiou: oh, disks is breaking out of the list in WebKit too... perhaps I'm seeing the WebKit issue for the consoles as a result, as my VM has a LOT of information for disks and it doesn't wrap
T 1600259495 18<garrett18>	so then it thinks there's more space for the console too
T 1600259538 18<kkoukiou18>	garrett: It's because that terminal is broken and disks tab thinks there is more space and expands.
T 1600259541 18<garrett18>	oh, it's a problem in Chrome too, but not as much
T 1600259561 18<garrett18>	kkoukiou: right, but the other way around, I think
T 1600259595 18<kkoukiou18>	garrett: Well you can easily check it by removing the whole node for consoles card
T 1600259599 18<garrett18>	kkoukiou: either way, regardless of what's going too wide, something is going too wide and the other is following along, breaking the layout in Chrome and especially WebKit
T 1600259603 18<kkoukiou18>	And see if the other one is fixed
T 1600259635 18<garrett18>	good point; I hadn't tried it for disks; I did for snapshots earlier
T 1600259647 18<garrett18>	but snapshots had other issues too
T 1600259690 18<garrett18>	kkoukiou: I removed the console and there's still a problem with disks
T 1600259700 18<garrett18>	at least in Safari

T 1600326631 18<mmarusak18>	pitti, yeah, centos-8 went rather bad...
T 1600326650 18<pitti18>	mmarusak: we don't have an API for enumerating for which times we have data available (that's another outstanding jira ticket)
T 1600326672 18<pitti18>	mmarusak: so for now, my gut feeling is to start with the last 14 days?
T 1600326700 18<pitti18>	we load 12 hour blocks (I think) by default, but nothing stops us from loading an entire day
T 1600326714 18<pitti18>	and if you go back several days, then this is probably useful
T 1600326763 18<mmarusak18>	pitti, so you mean to have there items ["now", "yesterday", 15/9/2020, 14/9/2020...]?

T 1600326809 18<pitti18>	mmarusak: the former, yes; maybe a date picker too, but that can also be a follow-up
T 1600326817 18<mmarusak18>	pitti, sshd.service - you got that on cOS8?
T 1600326821 18<pitti18>	yes

T 1600326837 18<pitti18>	so the entire IdM stuff is broken, too
T 1600328765 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: hmm, services image refresh is broken -- I'll leave that to you as pilot, and just hammer on the centos-8 refresh :)

T 1600330695 18<pitti18>	it's the "new sh*t* pipeline :)

T 1600331590 18<mvollmer18>	so when I want FreeIPA in a container, I have to decide which base os it should use?  And there is no obvious default?  What is that about?
T 1600331746 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: ugh, there's no :latest any more?
T 1600331756 18<mvollmer18>	doesn't look like it
T 1600331787 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: so maybe "centos-8" isn't the worst default -- fedora:32 we'd have to bump rather often
T 1600331813 18<mvollmer18>	but I mean, why do I even have the option of using a FreeIPA container made out of fedora-30?  Maybe I misunderstand things totally...
T 1600331969 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: yeah, that's a bit stupid -- the whole idea of containers is that you don't care much how they are built..
T 1600331997 18<pitti18>	:fedora and :centos I could still understand, but by fedora release is over the top
T 1600332002 18<pitti18>	that may be worth a bug report
T 1600332023 18<kkoukiou18>	ah sending the release email now

T 1600332042 18<kkoukiou18>	pitti: was about to check that first :)
T 1600332048 18<mvollmer18>	oh, I need to review that
T 1600332049 18<pitti18>	I did some updates this morning, but it should still get another review
T 1600332074 18<kkoukiou18>	ok :) Then I will be around
T 1600332077 18<kkoukiou18>	Good morning all
T 1600332082 18<pitti18>	kalimera!
T 1600332119 18<pitti18>	kkoukiou: flewn any patterns yet? how about a simple looping for starters?
T 1600332185 18<kkoukiou18>	i actually did ;) their issues are simple - I only now trying to understand their testing
T 1600332204 18<kkoukiou18>	pitti: They use jest - take a snapshot of the generated html and compare it with a static file
T 1600332219 18<kkoukiou18>	Different approach than what we do
T 1600332241 18<pitti18>	I suppose they need to be much more concerned about pixel perfection than we do
T 1600332287 18<kkoukiou18>	pitti:true but that does not compare images but html so the problem of pixel perfection is still there :)
T 1600332293 18<pitti18>	yeah, right
T 1600332299 18<kkoukiou18>	Anyway :) Interesting it is
T 1600332458 18<pitti18>	mvollmer, mmarusak: after we land the new graphs pages, the only remaining consumers of jquery-flot are the storage page and the dashboard
T 1600332493 18<pitti18>	we may still kick out the dashboard entirely (maybe into a separate project, and then let it slowly wither and die), but I feel we should udpate the storage page
T 1600332525 18<pitti18>	we could use https://www.patternfly.org/v4/documentation/react/charts/sparkline (with some hacks), or a simple progress bar like we have on the Overview page for CPU/memory, and then link to the graphs page for the history; WDYT?
T 1600332530 18<pitti18>	I'm actually leaning towards the latter
T 1600332531 18<andreasn18>	garrett: intructions for how to test the Smart patching PR https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/14581#issuecomment-692852552
T 1600332553 18<garrett18>	andreasn: thanks
T 1600332591 18<mmarusak18>	pitti, \o/ to dropping the jquery-plot. And agree that we should migrate storage page in the meantime and then "deal with" dashboard in one way or another
T 1600332638 18<andreasn18>	garrett: I think for testing reboot, the fedora test image might have  a kernel update or something already, so if you "dnf install tracer" first, and then open Cockpit, I think you'll get that behavior
T 1600332665 18<andreasn18>	but Simon pushed a lot of fixes for the branch the other day, so make sure to pull down his changes first
T 1600332716 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: (same question for the networkmanager page)
T 1600332877 18<mvollmer18>	what question?
T 1600332994 18<mvollmer18>	pitti: hmm, maybe the freeipa baseos determines which version of FreeIPA you are getting...
T 1600333006 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: sparkline vs. progress, and linking to the graphs page
T 1600333020 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: not urgent, and not blocking right now, it just came to my mind
T 1600333052 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: yeah, but we surely don't want something like fedora-29 there any more, it's not going to be updated
T 1600333100 18<pitti18>	kkoukiou, garrett, mvollmer: release notes LGTM now -- time to land?
T 1600333108 18<kkoukiou18>	pitti: Okay :)
T 1600333112 18<mvollmer18>	pitti: yeah, I thought the container has latest FreeIPA release, installed into different OSes.
T 1600333135 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: supposedly it's just dnf install freeipa-server, and then some config bits around it?
T 1600333136 18<garrett18>	pitti: looking over them right now... but I have a 1:1 in 2 minutes
T 1600333157 18<mvollmer18>	pitti: I guess you are right, what a weird thing to do.
T 1600333162 18<pitti18>	garrett: ah thanks, then let's wait a bit
T 1600333191 18<pitti18>	mvollmer: yeah, I don't understand it either -- like why do I care how they built it..
T 1600333193 18*	mvollmer understands the world less and less...
T 1600333221 18*	pitti is > 40 now as well, so more "being grumpy" rights
T 1600333290 18<mvollmer18>	maybe they use the containers to easily test against the various supported versions of FreeIPA, then it makes sense
T 1600333342 18<mvollmer18>	ab is right here, we could just ask him. :-)
T 1600333388 18<pitti18>	if they use that for their own CI, that's fine -- but that's not the same as "what would real users pick"

T 1600333626 18<mvollmer18>	pitti: ah, there was an issue about it: https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container/issues/343
T 1600333651 18<pitti18>	for you it's README.focus.md
T 1600333654 18<mvollmer18>	looks like someone got burned using "latest" naively

T 1600333689 18<ab18>	but :latest is not going back
T 1600333705 18<mvollmer18>	ab: I have no idea what's going on, so I don't think I should document what's going on.
T 1600333751 18<mvollmer18>	ab: so which tag do you recommend for someone that was happy with "latest"?
T 1600333759 18<ab18>	mvollmer: well, you can add a tag <:tag> and mention https://hub.docker.com/r/freeipa/freeipa-server/tags for tags
T 1600333771 18<ab18>	mvollmer: I already answered that question on the ticket you opened ;)
T 1600333780 18<ab18>	are you reading it? :)
T 1600333833 18<mvollmer18>	yes, had to reload
T 1600333858 18<mvollmer18>	so fedora-rawhide?
T 1600333905 18<ab18>	I guess so, it would correspond to your intent, right?
T 1600333915 18<mvollmer18>	let me ask in a different way, what was "latest" pointing to earlier?
T 1600334012 18<pitti18>	rawhide should be okay -- we don't need to change the tag, and we won't be affected by random installability failures, as the container build process shields us from that
T 1600334048 18<ab18>	current process is that we build containers, test them and if the tests succeeded, the containers get uploaded
T 1600334054 18<ab18>	with corresponding tags
T 1600334062 18<pitti18>	that sounds great
T 1600334064 18<ab18>	before it was different
T 1600334101 18<ab18>	https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa-container/commit/7e803c4fdf193bf6be458c45de13f0d565332333
T 1600334108 18<ab18>	these are the images pushed
T 1600334181 18<pitti18>	ab: so e.g. the centos-7 host would still only have centos-7's freeipa, not the latest upstream version, right?
T 1600334188 18<ab18>	correct
T 1600334191 18<pitti18>	i.e. the tag reflects what's inside, not what host OS to run it on
T 1600334199 18<ab18>	they are using cotent from the os
T 1600334203 18<ab18>	*content

T 1600334222 18<pitti18>	so I think :fedora-rawhide is fine
T 1600334272 18<pitti18>	they are gated, and it's the only stable tag name, and it has the most recent version so that we can spot regressions as early as possible

T 1600346420 18<garrett18>	andreasn: I still cannot get the tracer branch working
T 1600346431 18<garrett18>	andreasn: it does an immediate install still
T 1600346436 18<andreasn18>	garrett: what issues are you hitting?
T 1600346445 18<garrett18>	I click the button, it immediately installs
T 1600346454 18<garrett18>	isn't the branch supposed to do something?!
T 1600346471 18<garrett18>	I ran the dnf command
T 1600346477 18<andreasn18>	I think that is expected behavior. It gives a message about needing reboot or needing to restart services post install
T 1600346491 18<garrett18>	oh, after a minute of it sitting there after saying "system is up to date", I get a badly placed warning
T 1600346498 18<garrett18>	about rebooting
T 1600346498 18<andreasn18>	that is the UI!
T 1600346504 18<garrett18>	andreasn: this behavior is 100% wrong
T 1600346513 18<garrett18>	as I said a few times already
T 1600346522 18<garrett18>	it needs to be up-front about possible reboots
T 1600346548 18<garrett18>	and immediately reboot after being done
T 1600346579 18<garrett18>	it cannot run a mix-up of various packages updated on disk but not in memory; that can cause a false sense of security, data loss, and other issues
T 1600346582 18<andreasn18>	oh, reboot right away after update? I think I disagree. You need time to find the update window, warn those that depend on any services on your system etc
T 1600346585 18<garrett18>	(like crashing apps)
T 1600346596 18<garrett18>	andreasn: huh?
T 1600346604 18<garrett18>	andreasn: no, it needs to be known BEFORE updating
T 1600346613 18<andreasn18>	right, that I agree with
T 1600346618 18<garrett18>	if you update, it's already too late, as you have to reboot then
T 1600346621 18<andreasn18>	but the reboot action must be in the hands of the sysadmin
T 1600346653 18<garrett18>	again, if you update and it requires restarting things and/or rebooting, you need to know BEFORE, so you can take that into account
T 1600346656 18<garrett18>	this is completely broken
T 1600346671 18<garrett18>	there's also no way to reboot or anything either
T 1600346686 18<garrett18>	this is supposed to be a flow, and now it isn't at all
T 1600346711 18<andreasn18>	I think Simon did a good attempt, I am not mad at him for not getting this right. I hope you feel the same
T 1600346724 18<garrett18>	I'm not mad
T 1600346726 18<garrett18>	but this isn't right
T 1600346759 18<garrett18>	it's nowhere near ready for merging and is a regression over what we already have (which isn't ideal, to be sure, but it at least has a flow and some guidance)
T 1600346935 18<garrett18>	andreasn: what happened to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-design/master/software-updates/service-updates-no-reboot.png ?
T 1600346974 18<andreasn18>	I think Simon was aware of those mockups, but ended up implementing it as a dialog instead
T 1600347020 18<andreasn18>	you will get this behavior if you run the command I posted in the PR, where you first upgrade everything, install httpd and then downgrade it
T 1600347027 18<garrett18>	right, so where's the dialog?
T 1600347037 18<garrett18>	yes, but that's not working here
T 1600347065 18<garrett18>	it's totally broken here on my machine, like I said, if I'm supposed to see a dialog or some way to restart the machine
T 1600347085 18<garrett18>	I'm expecting to see something that looks something like the PR
T 1600347093 18<garrett18>	I don't know why my VM isn't working
T 1600347161 18<garrett18>	my point is that there's something wrong, as the command isn't working as expected
T 1600347174 18<andreasn18>	do you get some messages in the console?
T 1600347187 18<andreasn18>	I had a lot of issues before getting this to work
T 1600347218 18<garrett18>	Nothing, Spawn, Object {...}, Required Reboot, Nothing 2, Required Reboot, Nothing 2
T 1600347224 18<garrett18>	those are the lines I see
T 1600347234 18<andreasn18>	Required Reboot is the correct line there
T 1600347241 18<andreasn18>	so tracer is doing it's thing

T 1600347286 18<garrett18>	ok, then there's some kind of issue between tracer and the UI?
T 1600347351 18<andreasn18>	yeah, could be. I had a lot of issues in the past

T 1600350702 18<garrett18>	mmarusak: I was talking about something like "rpm -qf /usr/lib/systemd/system/* | sort -u" for a list of currently installed packages that have service files, for example
T 1600350829 18<garrett18>	mmarusak: my point is that we're not installing or removing packages; we're upgrading them, so we can take a shortcut to determine if something needs to happen or not on the system _before_ the update
