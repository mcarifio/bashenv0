T 1587744573 18<Satishven18>	Hi Team
T 1587744586 18<Satishven18>	We were trying to use Open API 3 for our rest APIs which have XMLs as payload.  So we want to place xsd in schema and xml in example/examples. But we came across few blogs which suggests it’s not supported by open API 3, instead we need to convert xsd to jschema and use it.
T 1587747967 18<ron18>	Satishven: you can'd use xsd directly with OAS3. You'd need to convert it sort of to JSON Schema, but not everything in XML is supported so that might not work. As for examples, you should be able to provide XML without an issue.

T 1588009807 18<ron18>	and no, you don't. it'll simply mount your local path to a /tmp path in the docker iimage

T 1588069759 18<mloskot18>	Hi, I'm trying to understand development & build workflow of the codegen v3, and I'm no Java developer.
T 1588069766 18<mloskot18>	I have learned about the split of the swagger-codegen and swagger-codegen-generators and that the former uses the latter.
T 1588069800 18<mloskot18>	If I patch the swagger-codegen-generators, locally or in my fork on GitHub, how do I make the swagger-codegen use the patched version?
T 1588069854 18<mloskot18>	Do I just `mvn clean package` inside swagger-codegen-generators and then copy my build of swagger-codegen-generators-1.0.20-SNAPSHOT.jar over to swagger-codegen?
T 1588069858 18<mloskot18>	Where to exactly?
T 1588069897 18<mloskot18>	I have looked at obvious places like README.md's, CONTRIBUTING.md, Wiki.,but I can

T 1588088716 18<ron18>	mloskot: let me get back to you on that.

T 1588088749 18<ron18>	oh, good, sorry about the delay.
T 1588088768 18<mloskot18>	I noticed, that swagger-codegen-generators is deployed in `.m2` cache, but it is downloaded
T 1588088816 18<mloskot18>	What I did was, bump the version number in all `pom.xml` files, then bump it in pom.xml files of swagger-codegen too, so it will not try to download any packages of the swagger-codegen-generators
T 1588088843 18<mloskot18>	Then, I do `mvn clean packge install` inside swagger-codegen-generators, this deplpys the package in the `.m2` cache
T 1588088862 18<mloskot18>	Finally, I build swagger-codegen which 'links' against my build of the swagger-codegen-generators
T 1588088887 18<ron18>	generally speaking, when you `mvn clean install`, it will override the version in your .m2 dir
T 1588088888 18<mloskot18>	If this is the canonical way to achieve my goal, I have no idea whatsoever, but it works
T 1588088900 18<ron18>	that's what the 'install' does, it 'installs' it locally.
T 1588088923 18<ron18>	but bumping the version is not a bad idea
T 1588088949 18<mloskot18>	Right,  but codegen declares it wants generators of version `1.0.20-SNAPSHOT`, so I wasn't sure if it will download it anyway, despite I installed my own build
T 1588088964 18<mloskot18>	I bumped the versions as sanity check
T 1588088971 18<ron18>	sure
T 1588088998 18<ron18>	generally, if a file is in your .m2 dir, it won't be downloaded again unless you force it (with a flag)
T 1588089135 18<mloskot18>	I see
T 1588089137 18<mloskot18>	Thanks!
T 1588089207 18<ron18>	you probably figured out that maven is a build/repository tool by now
T 1588089218 18<ron18>	the .m2 dir is pretty much your local repository
T 1588089348 18<mloskot18>	You know what I did, I looked how I can make mvn command more verbose... and I used -X then I analysed the log to see what it does where it puts things... :-)
T 1588089435 18<mloskot18>	I know it's probably silly, but I have zero experience with Maven and very little with Java ecosystem in general
T 1588089448 18<mloskot18>	It did the trick though :)
T 1588089556 18<ron18>	that's a sign of a good developer. you didn't just give up.

We currently have a working prototype with Springfox 2.9, but we want to migrate to Java 11 and Springfox doesn't yet work well with that. We're considering migrating from Springfox to a pure Swagger-Core 1.6.1 + Swagger-UI 2.X
T 1588859497 18<nak18>	implementation, since we already have the Swagger annotations in our classes. Are there any resources you can recommend for this?
T 1588861242 18<ron18>	eobermuhlner: there is not from the editor. if you need to set options, you can use the generator service directly. Which version of the specification do you use?

T 1588861276 18<ron18>	nak: what library is at the core of your API?
T 1588861768 18<nak18>	@ron We use Spring Framework 5.2.2
T 1588861776 18<ron18>	so Spring MVC?
T 1588861801 18<nak18>	yeah, Spring MVC
T 1588861828 18<ron18>	in that case, unfortunately, you can't use Swagger Core. We only support JAX-RS applications.
T 1588861829 18<nak18>	we have about a dozen Controllers and 2-3 times as many views, with annotations

T 1588861837 18<nak18>	I see

T 1588861900 18<ron18>	given that there are solid options for Spring, we never got into adding support to those.
T 1588861934 18<nak18>	Yeah. The problem is that Springfox has problems with Java 11 (split packages), while Springdocs requires Spring Boot
T 1588861973 18<nak18>	and we currently don't use Spring Boot, so adding that may be too much of a refactor
T 1588861998 18<nak18>	In addition, Springdocs uses Swagger 3, so it would mean replacing all of our annotations
T 1588862312 18<ron18>	yeah, that makes sense
T 1588862323 18<ron18>	are there any tickets in springfox about java 11 support?
T 1588862386 18<nak18>	yeah, there are, multiple in fact about Java versions beyond Java 8. There is talks of fixing this for Springfox 3, but apparently it's not yet fixed
T 1588862599 18<nak18>	Also, the lead developer apparently lost his job due to COVID and he's focusing on his job hunt. There are still loads of things that don't work properly in 3.0.0, so it'll probably be a while before a new release

T 1589312886 18<ron18>	oh, it's a manual writing
T 1589312918 18<ron18>	are you aware of the conversions tools that are available and can help with that?

T 1589313141 18<ron18>	no worries
T 1589313177 18<ron18>	generally speaking, when writing definitions manually, I recommend using YAML over JSON as it's faster, less cluttered and just cleaner.
T 1589313239 18<ron18>	you can take your definition, paste it into editor.swagger.io and then from the Edit menu, choose convert to OpenAPI 3.
T 1589313613 18<trav18>	so the challenge i have here is that the existing docs reference many many json files, so i guess my first task would be to reassemble them back into a single file then try and run it through the site you menthioned?
T 1589313674 18<ron18>	ok, that's different indeed.
T 1589313689 18<ron18>	there may be some other tools out there that can do that, I'm just not sure.
T 1589313739 18<trav18>	also with yaml how would you define a json response example, would you have to write the json as yaml?
T 1589313848 18<ron18>	yaml is a superset of json, so any valid json is actually a valid yaml
T 1589313869 18<ron18>	(that's 99% accurate, fairly certain you won't hit the 1% that isn't)
T 1589313902 18<ron18>	you don't have to use yaml, but you can save yourself some effort by not having to use curly braces and quotes all over.

Is there a way in maven to add that project to the Maven reactor to build it?

T 1600363920 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	The feature was implemented in PR 5278 in response to issue 4300 - it relates to providing a "copy" button in the request body section of the API examples.
T 1600363954 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	I was reading release notes and it looks like that went into version 3.27.0 and version 3.33.0 is live on editor.swagger.io but I cannot figure out the correct YAML to enable it.
T 1600364115 18<ron18>	it looks like it works out of the box
T 1600364199 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	Could you help me understand how? I am looking at https://editor.swagger.io/ as the example. When I expand any of the API requests, I do not see the "copy" button in the region where the example request body exists.
T 1600364242 18<ron18>	that PR doesn't allow you to copy the example, it allows you to copy the response received when running an operation
T 1600364260 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	Oh interesting - so my finding is that it is present in the *response* (after using "try it out"), but it is not available in the *request*.
T 1600364283 18<ron18>	correct
T 1600364307 18<ron18>	issue 4300 is talking about responses
T 1600364385 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	Is adding that to the request something the team would consider if it were submitted as an issue? My use case looks something like this - we use Swagger UI for the API documentation, but the "try it out" feature is not enabled. So the user copies the request body information from the API example and uses a tool like Postman or Curl to issue the req
T 1600364385 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	uest. The "copy" button for this use case would be especially helpful if it would allow us to copy the request body.
T 1600364450 18<ron18>	so you're saying postman is better than the UI
T 1600364589 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	Haha no - I haven't had the opportunity to use the UI "try it out" in my work environment so I don't have a proper base to compare them. Our environment just isn't set up to respond to requests this way. Surely there are ways to configure that but it's not my department. I'm just seeking an optimal way to extract useful information presented in Swa

T 1600364607 18<ron18>	I was kidding.
T 1600364627 18<ron18>	I'm not opposed to adding that option, so feel free to file a ticket. However, given the amount of tickets we have, I can't guarantee when we'll get around to it.
T 1600364711 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	I figured it might have been a joke, but in any case that's kind of where I am at. It certainly would be ideal to be able to use what Swagger UI has to offer in that way, but where I am it's currently not something we are able to do.
T 1600364770 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	And excellent, thank you @ron! I will look into what is required to submit this request. I most certainly understand how backlog/priority stuff goes so I am just interested in putting it out there in case others would also find such a feature to be useful.
T 1600364838 18<ron18>	yup, that's the way to do it, thanks
T 1600364885 18<Bernard_Bernoull18>	Awesome. Thanks, @ron!

T 1600440735 18<maniacal18>	Good morning.  Is there a way to represent a key that may or not be in a response.  I have a 'location' key that may or may not be there.  I have a schema for if it is.   if it isn't I'm using a empty schmea of type: object.  but this shows "location": {} in the response.  I would rather not show the location key at all
T 1600441187 18<maniacal18>	Mabye I found it.  there is a 'required' setting for responses.  never realized that.  If I make all the fields except 'location' required in the response, does that accurately represent that  the location object may not be there?
T 1600441226 18<maniacal18>	meaning, is that the intent of 'required' on responses?  and is that proper swaggering?
