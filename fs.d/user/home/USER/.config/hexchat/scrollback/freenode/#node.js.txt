T 1600371466 18<fattredd18>	I'm cool with that. How do I do it though? Event emitters or something? I guess I could have a cmdQueue array in the module, and just append commands as I receive them. Then a struct with all the data that might need to be exposed. I keep thinking there's got to be a better way though
T 1600371547 18<samsch18>	I'd recommend trying a couple ways of doing it. See what the problems are with the naive approach, then see if you can mitigate those in a slightly-less naive version. After some iterations on it, check out some generic state libraries, there are various things which may be suitable.

T 1600466220 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: you have to import from the transpiler output
T 1600466226 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: ie, from build, not from src

T 1600466282 18<ycon_18>	Is there an alternative option?
T 1600466853 18<ycon_18>	Is this kind of like a microservices approach?
T 1600466909 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: no, that's how it's done
T 1600466920 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: the alternative is "don't use syntax that requires babel"
T 1600466973 18<ycon_18>	ljharb: so there's no way I could just "import" outside of the src folder, that would work with babel
T 1600466992 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: i don't know what you mean by "outside of the src folder"
T 1600467012 18<ljharb18>	a published package should never ever try to require/import files outside of itself, that means it isn't properly encapsulated
T 1600467200 18<ycon_18>	ljharb: Hmm so does that mean the 'node-library' should be made into an npm package?
T 1600467418 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: well yeah, if you want to import it from something else
T 1600467510 18<ycon_18>	by "outside of the src folder" I mean, ideally to make dev smoother- would have my repo setup like: root/server, root/server-library
T 1600467549 18<ycon_18>	Then form `root/server` I could just do `import serverLib from '../../server-lib' ` and it could be babel

T 1600467613 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: that's strictly worse than `import serverLib from '@mycompany/server-lib'` or something
T 1600467825 18<ycon_18>	ljharb: To make it simpler to modify `server-lib` (which is for generic stuff). how do you mean "worse"

T 1600467871 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: then you should use a workspaces tool
T 1600467923 18<ycon_18>	I've found mono-repo's/learna more trouble than they're worth, the abstraction and pain of config

T 1600467970 18<ljharb18>	ycon_: if you want to avoid the trouble, then do the normal thing and publish each thing as a package, and use it that way

T 1600468075 18<ljharb18>	yes
T 1600468096 18<ljharb18>	you can have a monorepo without any monorepo tooling, it just means you cd into each directory and work on it in isolation, including publishing it.

T 1600468190 18<ycon_18>	I guess if I really wanted to non use packages, I could have a 'complile-all' script that creates the the build folders in each

T 1600468237 18<ljharb18>	no monorepo tooling, everything can import everything else, one build process - that's just "a single repo"

T 1600603667 18<akersof18>	joepie91 yeah looks like the "wiser" way
T 1600603678 18<joepie9118>	the bottom line is that there's really no reason to switch
T 1600603736 18<joepie9118>	and, honestly, probably never will be
T 1600603855 18<akersof18>	indeed, well i was thinking of esm because 1) my students learnt react.js before my course so well they already used the esm syntax, and 2) the native support form node now
T 1600603894 18<akersof18>	Ok, i will probably go back and start using the 'require' syntax
T 1600603965 18<joepie9118>	React can be used just fine with CommonJS, btw
T 1600603997 18<joepie9118>	it's just that the frontend community jumped in import/export really quickly, even when there were no spec-compliant implementations yet and Babel was doing the wrong thing
T 1600604000 18<joepie9118>	so now that's everywhere
T 1600604005 18<joepie9118>	jumped on*
T 1600604013 18<akersof18>	joepie91but my point of view is you know how web dev/ecosystem drive how we should work now, so if the web side says we should use esm, i think we will switch on the node.js too soon
T 1600604029 18<joepie9118>	I don't think that should be the case
T 1600604039 18<joepie9118>	the correct thing to use is that which works best for a problem
T 1600604055 18<joepie9118>	popularity doesn't really factor into it
T 1600604090 18<joepie9118>	and considering the absolute clusterfuck that is ESM support vs. how CommonJS just works the same everywhere, without any real downsides... this seems like an obvious choice to me :P
T 1600604105 18<joepie9118>	regardless of what got hyped up in frontend land
T 1600604113 18<akersof18>	joepie91you are talking like a real programmer :)  not as what i see on web dev junkies side
T 1600604125 18<joepie9118>	this is IMO extra important in JS-land which is exceptionally hype-sensitive
T 1600604158 18<joepie9118>	akersof: the same *should* apply in webdev, though
T 1600604164 18<joepie9118>	webdev is also programming
T 1600604219 18<akersof18>	joepie91 yeah ofc, thank you for these informations :)

T 1609966760 18<wisbit18>	are ultra noob questions allowed here ? xD
T 1609966803 18<wisbit18>	I got a database scraper nodejs script, and I not figuring it much
T 1609966817 18<wisbit18>	one basic function is   Scraper.getSeriesUrlFromLetter(letter: string, proxy?: Proxy): Promise<string[]>;
T 1609966834 18<wisbit18>	it's expecting a letter, and I have no idea how to get it there

T 1609966909 18<wisbit18>	that's what I did, can't even initiate the file
T 1609966994 18<zsoc18>	wisbit: that's not javascript, that is an expression of the signature of that function
T 1609967034 18<zsoc18>	it means "Scraper.getSeriesUrlFromLetter() take two arguments, the first one is a string representing the letter, and the second one is an option proxy object. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of strings"
T 1609967093 18<joepie9118>	wisbit: (yes, beginner questions are fine!)
T 1609967215 18<wisbit18>	the consoel underlines "letter" and tells me it's missing a ) after argument list
T 1609967231 18<wisbit18>	by underlines I mean ^^^^^^^^
T 1609967248 18<ljharb18>	well yeah, you need a closing paren
T 1609967287 18<wisbit18>	Scraper.getSeriesUrlFromLetter(letter: string, proxy?: Proxy) <- that thing ?
T 1609967299 18<ljharb18>	the `?` isn't proper js syntax
T 1609967306 18<ljharb18>	neither is `letter:` et

T 1609967324 18<ljharb18>	wisbit: for example, you could call `Scraper.getSeriesUrlFromLetter('a')`
T 1609967333 18<ljharb18>	wisbit: or `Scraper.getSeriesUrlFromLetter('a', proxyInstance)`
T 1609967349 18<GreenJello18>	and remove the part after the )
T 1609967355 18<ljharb18>	right
T 1609967402 18<wisbit18>	the "promise" bit ?
T 1609967445 18<GreenJello18>	wisbit, yeah, it's presumably the documentation telling you what the function returns, not actual code
T 1609967482 18<zsoc18>	wisbit: look at the "Basic Usage" section of the documentation near the top - that's the part that shows how to actually use the function
T 1609967504 18<wisbit18>	zsoc, that's exactly where I got that thing from :D
T 1609967518 18<wisbit18>	woudl you care if I sent you the github link of the script ?

T 1609967574 18<zsoc18>	i see it already, i'm just saying you are not using the suggestion in basic usage
T 1609967581 18<zsoc18>	the basic usage shows you how to use it xD
T 1609967596 18<zsoc18>	Can I ask also why you are creating a server here? How is that helping.
T 1609967624 18<wisbit18>	I don't have an answer to that question, I am still trying to figure out the whole thing
T 1609967629 18<wisbit18>	I'll look again at the doc
