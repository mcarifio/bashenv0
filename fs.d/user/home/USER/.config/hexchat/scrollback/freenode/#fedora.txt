T 1600434782 18<xaphir18>	jim87, check your laptop touchpad and keyboard function with an f console
T 1600434798 18<xaphir18>	See if it works there or if the problem is endemic to X
T 1600434854 18<xaphir18>	jim87, make sure you have gpm installed for console mouse support
T 1600434919 18<xaphir18>	jim87, systemctl enable gpm; systemctl start gpm
T 1600435052 18<Khaytsus18>	And compare xinput when it's working and when it's failed.  I guess it just won't show up.  Assuming using X, no idea about Wayland.
T 1600435096 18<xaphir18>	jim87, you may be missing an X synaptics driver, unless gpm won't respond at the console.  Then it's something else at the driver level.
