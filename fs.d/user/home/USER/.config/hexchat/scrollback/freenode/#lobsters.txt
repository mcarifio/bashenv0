T 1600536319 18<V18>	You need way too much knowledge of how it works internally to do useful stuff with it
T 1600536335 18<V18>	(or perhaps the issue here is that the internals aren't placed front and center? and rather hidden away?)
T 1600536346 18<geoffwozniak18>	I think those who say "Git is awesome" are only looking at the "distributed" part of it and all the tooling around it
T 1600536392 18<geoffwozniak18>	The distributed part isn't novel or anything.  It just happens to be the DVCS that got popular
T 1600536400 18<aleph-18>	geoffwozniak: We can just reduce "Git is awesome" -> "VCS is awesome"

T 1600536570 18<geoffwozniak18>	Or they do their changes outside of the repo, copy it in, and then check things because they get confused by the branches and such
T 1600536618 18<geoffwozniak18>	"index or work tree?" for example
T 1600536636 18<geoffwozniak18>	Or "why doesn't 'checkout' actually check things out?"
T 1600536640 18<aleph-18>	Yeah admittedly I've done that when I've really fscked something up >_>
T 1600536688 18<aleph-18>	Like our remote git system still not allowing me to push a new commit after removing a broken commit
T 1600536690 18<geoffwozniak18>	Or that "git branch" doesn't switch you to that branch
T 1600536706 18<aleph-18>	Due to our pre commit hook barfing

T 1600536825 18<Ori_B18>	aleph-: yeah, though they never really cleaned it up
T 1600536826 18<geoffwozniak18>	Haven't even tried that

T 1600536838 18<Ori_B18>	so it has, like, 4 different ways of serializeing integers through the format.

T 1600536900 18<Ori_B18>	I'm still poking around at what git9 should be doing.
T 1600536906 18<geoffwozniak18>	aleph-: merging things then not realizing they have conflicts, etc.
T 1600536933 18<geoffwozniak18>	I'd call it "git make-branch" or something
T 1600536952 18<aleph-18>	Yah know I've never actually had that issue
T 1600536957 18<aleph-18>	How would you solve it?
T 1600536960 18<Ori_B18>	geoffwozniak: hm, git won't let you merge without telling it you resolved the conflicts.
T 1600536976 18<Ori_B18>	you need to resolve conficts and then 'git add' the files that conflicted.
T 1600537027 18<geoffwozniak18>	Well, for whatever reason, I've seen it happen
T 1600537059 18<geoffwozniak18>	Where they get into a state where they have made changes with a bad merge and have to sort it all out
T 1600537078 18<Ori_B18>	merges are a pain in the ass
T 1600537092 18<Ori_B18>	but I don't know of any VCS that makes them easy :/
T 1600537100 18<Ori_B18>	if you know of one that does, I'm all ears.
T 1600537102 18<geoffwozniak18>	Also, some are dead set against the idea of rebase and any rewriting of history
T 1600537124 18<geoffwozniak18>	Even if it's local and never shared
T 1600537124 18<Ori_B18>	I'd love to steal some ideas.
T 1600537143 18<Ori_B18>	oh. that's one thing that I should remember to do in git9 when I eventually write rebase.
T 1600537145 18<aleph-18>	Yeah merges can be awful
T 1600537151 18<aleph-18>	We usually never have issues here
T 1600537160 18<aleph-18>	And rebases are fine.
T 1600537172 18<aleph-18>	arc from phabricator does it automatically when merging a branch
T 1600537190 18<Ori_B18>	make sure rebase doesn't let you rebase before $remotes/$branch without a '-f' flag to forc e it.
T 1600537205 18<geoffwozniak18>	I prefer systems where the code review package does the work of rebasing, etc.
T 1600537217 18<Ori_B18>	aleph-: yeah, though phabricator isn't really doing a branch-based workflow.
T 1600537225 18<Ori_B18>	it's kind of putting a patch based workflow on top of git.
T 1600537228 18<Ori_B18>	which is good, IMO.
T 1600537234 18<aleph-18>	Yeah technically. I can see that
T 1600537237 18<geoffwozniak18>	I think ultimately I prefer a patch-based one
T 1600537243 18<aleph-18>	I'd run it at home if I was less lazy
T 1600537248 18<aleph-18>	But my small gitea setup is fine
T 1600537271 18<Ori_B18>	yeah, this is also the approach that got is angling towards.
